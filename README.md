# Matlab_StatsProject
This is my statistics project under professor Sharmishta Mitra in 2nd year summers. 
The problem statement- Draw random samples of size 10, 30 and 100 from a generalized exponential distribution and fit these to (a) GE distribution, (b) Weibull
                      distribution and (c) Lindley distribution and do a complete analysis of the estimates obtained in each case. 
I used matlab to simulate all the processes involved in fitting data to weibull distribtuion.
